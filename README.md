The projects is divided by the following folders:

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |

| [docs](https://github.com/dan1dr/microdosing/tree/main/docs) | The report and all the complementary docs related to the project |
| [front](https://github.com/dan1dr/microdosing/tree/main/front) | A dashboard for interactive use in Tableau, use this public [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel7193#!/) to access the dashboards, also you can find the files .twbx|

| [notebooks](https://github.com/dan1dr/microdosing/tree/main/notebooks) | Jupyter notebooks with the code |


Please, follow the steps listed below if you want to replicate the work.

## 2. Instructions for running

1. Import the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) into your local environment for ensuring the right working.
2. Open the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/dan1dr/microdosing/tree/main/notebooks) and follow the numbering for running the Jupyter notebooks (notebooks not numbered are just for quick exploration).
3. You can also consult the [report]() along the exploration, which describes the main results obtained during the analysis and a **essential** introduction to the topic of psychedelics.
4. The folder [front](https://github.com/dan1dr/microdosing/tree/main/front) contains the link for a visualization created with Tableau.
